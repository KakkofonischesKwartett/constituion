#Constitution of the Kakkofonian Nation

##Preamble

In acknowledgement of their responsibility, animated by beer, as the solely entitled member and due to their 
infinite wisdom the Kakkofonian Kwartett have come up with this device. Because the old one got lost.

This device is applicable to all Kakkofonians - Bitches!

##I. Basic Rights - primarily Basic Duties

###Article 1

The dignity of defecation is inviolable. That of the common, or mean, Kakkofonian is not either.

### Article 2

Honour your excrement! The excrement of every Kakkofonian especially that of the King and the Kartattaunts is credited
with magical powers. The same goes for flatulence. Particularly loud or aromatic presentations are to be recognized with a respectful
"YO!" by all Kakkofonians present and possibly even a fanfare.

###Article 3

The dignity of beer is inviolable. To spill it is punishable by revocation of Kakkofonianship.
To drink beer is the holiest of all kakkofonian Duties. Failure to comply would be stupid and is also punishable by revocation
of the Kakkofonianship.

###Article 4

The Original Kakkofonians, every member of the Kakkofonian Kwartett as well as any appointed officials are as a matter of course Kakkofonians.

###Article 5

All Kakkofonians are equal before the gossip. Only the Kakkofonian King is considerably more equal.

###Article 6

Every Kakkofonian has a basic right to the consumption of beer, caffein, nicotine and toilet paper.
